# Roman Numerals

A small program to convert roman symbols to integers.

## Usage

You can simply use the functions by importing the file:

```python
import RomanNumeral as RN
print(RN.romanToInt("MMXXII"))
print(RN.determineForm("MMXXII"))
```

Or you can use the commandline like this:

python .\test_input.py IIIIIV
```
